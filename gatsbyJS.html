<h1>Gatsby Talks Politics</h1>


<p> Gatsby is a three-year-old Labrador living in England. Gatsby has recently taken an interest in British politics. Gatsby finds human politics to be: </p>

<ul>
      <li>Confusing</li>
      <li>Silly</li>
      <li>Lacking the presence of dogs</li>
    </ul>

<p> Gatsby likes the Labour party. He thinks they're cool and wants to vote for them because:</p>
<ul>
      <li>He wants to protect the NHS</li>
      <li>He believes in a higher minimum wage</li>
      <li>He thinks the Tories' changes to working tax credits are deeply unfair </li>
      <li> He is scared of Theresa May's hair </li>
    </ul>

<p> Sadly, Gatsby cannot vote for Labour, because he's a dog. Will you give a puppy a smile today and vote for him? I suggest you do because, if you don't, Gatsby plans to take matters into his own hands</p>


<p> You see, Gatsby would also quite like to start his own party. This party will involve:
<ul>
      <li> Free puppies for all </l>
      <li> An end to the tyranny of cats </li>
      <li> Authoritarian rule and press censorship </li>


<div class='vote-button'>How should you vote?</div>

Vote for Labour: keep Gatsby from power </p>


 <div class="table">
<table>

  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Reasons to vote for the Tories </th>
    <th scope="col">Reasons to vote for Labour </th>
    <th scope="col"> Reasons to vote for Gatsby </th>
  </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
  <tr>
 <td rowspan="3"> There are none </td>
    <td> They will protect the NHS </td>
     <td> He's cute </td>
  </tr>

  
<tr>
    <td> They will protect policing </td>
    <td> He's fluffy </td>
  </tr>

<tr>
    <td> They will promote a higher minimum wage </td>
    <td> He's efficient and evil </td>
  </tr>
  </tr>


<p> In conclusion, vote for Labour. Or, if you're feeling reckless, vote for Gatsby </p>
