<h1>Gatsby Talks Politics</h1>


<p> Gatsby is a three-year-old Labrador living in England. Gatsby has recently taken an interest in British politics. Gatsby finds human politics to be: </p>

<ul>
      <li>Confusing</li>
      <li>Silly</li>
      <li>Lacking the presence of dogs</li>
    </ul>

<p> Gatsby likes the Labour party. He thinks they're cool and wants to vote for them because:</p>
<ul>
      <li>He wants to protect the NHS</li>
      <li>He cares about workers' rights</li>
      <li>He doesn't want a Hard Brexit </li>
      <li> He is scared of Theresa May's hair </li>
    </ul>

<p> Sadly, Gatsby cannot vote for Labour, because he's a dog. He feels this is grossly unfair. You are not a dog; you're (presumably) a human. So what's your excuse? You can register and vote Labour. And I suggest you do because, if you don't, Gatsby plans to take matters into his own hands</p>


<p> You see, Gatsby would also quite like to start his own party. This party will involve:
<ul>
      <li> Free puppies for all </li>
      <li> An end to the tyranny of cats </li>
      <li> Authoritarian rule and press censorship </li>
   </ul>
